  {name: "Workers Destroy Nuclear Plant", body: "The cooling towers at the site of a former nuclear plant in southwestern Germany have been demolished.

  A series of explosions took place at the Philippsburg power plant near Karlsruhe, and the timing of the demolition was kept in secret. Officials feared of potential crowds gathering at the site during the coronavirus pandemic.
  
  The plant´s two reactors were shut down in 2011 and 2019, as a part of Germany´s efforts to transition from nuclear energy. The country´s last reactor is set to go offline at the end of 2022.
  
  The site´s clearance is expected to take until 2029, and it will involve the removal of 500,000 tons of concrete and metal. A transformer station will be built on the site of the towers. It will help bring electricity generated from renewable resources in northern Germany to the country´s south."},
  {name: "Fish from a Lab", body: "A San Francisco-based cellular agriculture startup company has revealed the latest prototype of its cell-based salmon.

  The fish is made with real salmon cells that are grown in a brewery-like system in stainless steel tanks. A scaffold made from plant-based ingredients help the cells organize into a recognizable fish fillet shape. The company says that it aims to protect wild salmon and the oceans and help solve global food insecurity.
  
  Salmon is the second most consumed seafood after shrimp, and it´s the most consumed finfish. While demand for seafood is at an all-time high, wild fish continue to plummet, and salmon farms face warming coastal waters due to climate change. Fish are declining and there´s been a lot of movement toward alternative proteins. The lab-grown salmon will provide the same nutritional benefits as wild-caught fish without contaminants such as mercury, microplastics or antibiotics."},
  {name: "Scissors Inside Man", body: "18 years ago, a man from Vietnam had a traffic accident. He had to go to surgery but ever since he had been experiencing frequent sharp pains.

  Almost two decades later, an X-ray showed surgical scissors lying inside his abdomen. The doctors had left them inside him 18 years ago!
  
  Now, he has trusted the same hospital in northern Vietnam to remove the sharp tool. Doctors said that he is recovering and without a broken, rusty pair of scissors."},
  {name: "Instagram for Children", body: "Attorneys general of 44 US states and territories told Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg to ditch plans to create a version of Instagram for children.

  They wrote a letter stating social media is detrimental to children “who are not equipped to navigate the challenges of having a social media account.”
  
  They also said that Facebook has not protected children in the past, such as when they created a version of Facebook Messenger for children. They described that children were able to bypass the restrictions to join group chats with strangers who were not approved by their parents.
  
  Facebook responded it was exploring the idea of Instagram for children, it would protect their safety and privacy, and it would not show advertising."}
